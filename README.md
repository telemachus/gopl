# Notes and exercises for *The Go Programming Language*

This repo has my notes for *The Go Programming Language*. There’s also code for some of the exercises in the book. All of the notes are my own, but I got ideas for the exercises from [Jordan Torbiak’s repository of all the exercises in *GOPL*][torbiak]
